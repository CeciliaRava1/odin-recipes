        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound fresh sausage links (such as bratwurst, Italian sausage, or kielbasa)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Grill</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a gas grill to medium-high (400 degrees F to 450 degrees F 
                (200 degrees C to 230 degrees C)) on 1 side, or push hot coals to 1 side of a 
                charcoal grill. Place sausage links on the oiled grates over the unlit side of grill. </li>
            <li>Cover and grill until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of sausage registers 
                150 degrees F (66 degrees C), 8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway through cook time. </li>
            <li>Move sausage to the lit side of grill; grill, uncovered, turning once halfway through, 
                until browned and a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of sausage 
                registers 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 1 to 2 minutes. Serve as desired.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3>Oven</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet 
                with aluminum foil or parchment paper.  </li>
            <li>Arrange sausage links in an even layer, with at least 1-inch in between each link, 
                on prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion 
                registers 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), about 20 minutes. Serve as desired.  </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3>Skillet</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place sausage links in an even layer, with at least 1-inch in between each link in 
                a medium, high-sided skillet with about 1/4-inch water. Bring to a gentle simmer 
                over medium-high, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium to maintain a simmer; cover and cook, undisturbed, until 
                a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of sausage registers about 130 degrees F 
                (54 degrees C), 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Increase heat to medium-high, uncover and cook, turning occasionally, until water 
                is evaporated, sausages are brown, and a thermometer inserted into thickest portion 
                of sausage registers 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), about 8 minutes. Serve as desired. </li>
        </ol>
